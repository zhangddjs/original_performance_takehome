## 1. Visualization

### ✅ Problem

- [x] please generate an visualization example according to the problem.py, help me understand the core purpose of this problem, output html under visual/problem/ folder, remember to keep them concise
- [x] in the previous html, add a most simple example binary tree to show the traverse progress in an independent part on the page. The simple binary tree contains nodes 0 to 6, also you can comment the expected traverse progress so that I can validate whether the visualization works fine
- [x] you comment is not correct, that's fine, now give me an hash calculator under Problem Overview sector, so that I can check the issue
- [x] improve the Simple Example: Fixed Tree, add initial Tree, Input; what about different input under same Tree
- [x] then can you fix the issue in Binary Tree (Height = 2) sector, and during each step and round, display the whole input elements, contains indices[], values[], rounds
- [x] for Binary Tree (Height = 2), can you use multiple colors indicates different input batch_item, if several items on same node, can split this node or any possible solutions to diff them. Can you do it?

### Memory
